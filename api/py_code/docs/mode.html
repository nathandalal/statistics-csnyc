The <code>def</code> keyword defines a function. We see that we have named our function <code>get_median</code>.<br><br>
A function expects an input (here we expect a list that we call <code>numbers</code>).
A function also may return an output; in this case we want to find the mean of this list.<br><br>
Finally, the <code>:</code> at the end of the line and tne indenting in the rest of the code tells us that the code below is part of our function.

This is a <strong>docstring</strong>, a standard practice in Python to say what your function does. It helps others read your code.

This is a comment indicating we are making a dictionary. A dictionary is a structure that <b>maps a key to a value</b>.
Much like a normal dictionary, think of a key as a term and the value as its definition.<br><br>
This structure is sometimes called a <b>map</b> as well.

We <b>initialize a dictionary</b> with the curly braces <code>{}</code>, as shown in the code.
We access elements in the dictionary by using brackets <code>[]</code>, just like arrays.<br><br>
We want this dictionary to map <b>numbers in the list</b> to <b>how many times they appear</b>.



Now we are moving on to counting how many times each number appears, as indicated by this comment.

We make a variable called <code>number</code> that stores each element of our <code>numbers</code> list, one by one.<br><br>
This construction is called a <strong>for loop</strong>. The use of the keyword <code>for</code> allows us to walk through our list, getting each <code>number</code> one by one until we have gone through every <code>number in numbers</code>.<br><br>
The <code>:</code> and indenting is used again to show that the next four lines are part of our <strong>for loop</strong>.

This <b>if</b> statement checks if we have already inserted the number as a key in our dictionary.<br><br>
Python will give us an error if we try to access an element that is not in the dictionary.

In this case, this number was already in the dictionary, so we can simply update its value to show that <b>we have found the number one more time</b>.

This is the <b>else</b> case, indicating that the dictionary does not have this key. The next line handles this case.

We are seeing the key for the first time, which means that so far, we have seen it once. We assign its value to be one,
because so far we have seen it once.


  
This comment tells us we will now use our dictionary to find 

  modes, max_count = [], 0

  for number, count in nums_counts.items():

    if count > max_count:

      modes, max_count = [number], count

    elif count == max_count:

      modes = modes + [number]



  return modes
