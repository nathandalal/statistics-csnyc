The <code>def</code> keyword defines a function. We see that we have named our function <code>get_median</code>.<br><br>
A function expects an input (here we expect a list that we call <code>numbers</code>).
A function also may return an output; in this case we want to find the mean of this list.<br><br>
Finally, the <code>:</code> at the end of the line and tne indenting in the rest of the code tells us that the code below is part of our function.

This is the start of a <strong>docstring</strong>, a standard practice in Python to say what your function does. It helps others read your code.

Lines that begin with a <code>#</code> are comments. Comments are written to clarify code.<br><br>
This line explains that we must start finding the median by <strong>sorting</strong> the array.

We call our <code>selection_sort</code> function we wrote above to sort the list. We store our sorted list in our original variable.

We need to find the index that accesses the middle of our list. The <code>len()</code> function takes a list and returns its length. We divide this by 2 to get the middle, and we make sure to divide using integers. We do not want a decimal index (we don't want the 3.5th element of an array, for example).



This is a comment indicating we are moving on to picking the median using the middle index.

The <code>is_odd()</code> function here doesn't really exist. We've written it to make it simple to understand.
The way to write this line of code in Python without an <code>is_odd()</code> function would be like this:<br><br>
<pre>if len(numbers) % 2 == 1:</pre><br>
The <code>%</code> operator gets the remainder of a whole number or integer division problem. If the remainder when you divide by 2 is 1, the number is odd.

If the length is odd, there is only one true middle index, and we can return the list value at that index.

This is a comment indicating we are moving on to the case where the list is even in length.

The <code>else</code> operator says "do this if the previous <code>if</code> block did not work out". The <code>:</code> is for, as always, to signify that we
are starting a new indented block of code under <code>else</code>.

We are dividing the middle index and the one before it and dividing by 2 to get the average of the two middle elements.<br><br>
Lists in Python are <b>zero-indexed</b>. This means that index 4 is actually getting the 5th element of the list, and index 0 the 1st element in the list. If the list is even, this means that out of the two middle indexes, the value stored in the variable <code>middle_index</code> is the higher index and that is why we subtract by 1 to get the other middle index.<br><br>
