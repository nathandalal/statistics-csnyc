The <code>def</code> keyword defines a function. We see that we have named our function <code>get_mean</code>.<br><br>
A function expects an input (here we expect a list that we call <code>numbers</code>).
A function also may return an output; in this case we want to find the mean of this list.

Lines that begin with a <code>#</code> are comments. Comments are written to clarify code.<br><br>
This line explains that we must create some <strong>variables</strong>
to store what we would like to keep track of.

We want to create a variable that keeps track of the sum of the list. <code>sum_of_numbers</code> is a variable we will now initialize to store
the sum of the list as we go along.<br><br>
We haven't gone through any numbers yet, so we use the <code>=</code> operator to set our initial sum to <code>0</code>.

In order to calculate an average, we must also know how many elements are in the list. We make the <code>amount_of_numbers</code> variable to store this running count.<br><br>
We haven't gone through any numbers yet, so we use the <code>=</code> operator to set our initial amount of numbers we have seen to <code>0</code>.



  # sum all numbers by gradually adding

  for number in numbers

    numbers_sum += number

    numbers_size += 1



  # divide for the average

  mean_of_numbers = float(numbers_sum) / numbers_size

  return mean_of_numbers
