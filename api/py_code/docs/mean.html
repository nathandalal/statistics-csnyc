The <code>def</code> keyword defines a function. We see that we have named our function <code>get_mean</code>.<br><br>
A function expects an input (here we expect a list that we call <code>numbers</code>).
A function also may return an output; in this case we want to find the mean of this list.<br><br>
Finally, the <code>:</code> at the end of the line and tne indenting in the rest of the code tells us that the code below is part of our function.

Lines that begin with a <code>#</code> are comments. Comments are written to clarify code.<br><br>
This line explains that we must create some <strong>variables</strong>
to store what we would like to keep track of.

We want to create a variable that keeps track of the sum of the list. <code>sum_of_numbers</code> is a variable we will now initialize to store
the sum of the list as we go along.<br><br>
We haven't gone through any numbers yet, so we use the <code>=</code> operator to set our initial sum to <code>0</code>.

In order to calculate an average, we must also know how many elements are in the list. We make the <code>amount_of_numbers</code> variable to store this running count.<br><br>
We haven't gone through any numbers yet, so we use the <code>=</code> operator to set our initial amount of numbers we have seen to <code>0</code>.



Remember that we use <code>#</code> to indicate a comment. This one tells us we will begin going through each number in our list.

We make a variable called <code>number</code> that stores each element of our <code>numbers</code> list, one by one.<br><br>
This construction is called a <strong>for loop</strong>. The use of the keyword <code>for</code> allows us to walk through our list, getting each <code>number</code> one by one until we have gone through every <code>number in numbers</code>.<br><br>
The <code>:</code> and indenting is used again to show that the next two lines are part of our <strong>for loop</strong>.

We are adding the <code>number</code> to the existing <code>sum_of_numbers</code> variable as this number <b>adds to our running sum total</b>.<br><br>
The <code>+=</code> operator takes the existing value in <code>sum_of_numbers</code> and adds <code>number</code> to it. This is a nice shortcut offered by Python for the following code:
<pre><code>sum_of_numbers = sum_of_numbers + number</code></pre>

We are adding <code>1</code> to the existing <code>amount_of_numbers</code> counting variable as <b>we have seen one more number</b>.<br><br>
The <code>+=</code> operator takes the existing value in <code>amount_of_numbers</code> and adds <code>1</code> to it. This is a nice shortcut offered by Python for the following code:
<pre><code>amount_of_numbers = amount_of_numbers + 1</code></pre>



Another comment using <code>#</code> to indicate that we are done with our loop and now we must divide our sum and our count of the <code>numbers</code>.

We define a new variable and store our <code>answer</code>. Now, we need to simply divide our <code>sum_of_numbers</code> and <code>amount_of_numbers</code>.<br><br>
We call the <code>float()</code> function to convert our number from a whole number to a decimal. Whole numbers, positive or negative, in programming, are called <b>integers</b> and decimal numbers are called <b>floats</b>.<br><br>
We <strong>convert to a float because</strong> when two integers divide on computers, we lose the remainder in the division.

Finally the function must output an answer! We use the <code>return</code> keyword to send our output back. We have calculated the mean and we send out that variable as an output.<br></br>
