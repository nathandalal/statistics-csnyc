## Python Code

This subfolder contains all the code segments students will see.

`\src` contains all python files separated by one line using two spaces for indenting.
`\docs` contains HTML files that are a line-by-line guide on the code, with each HTML block being separated by two "\n" new line characters.
`py_api.js` exposes a library to read these folders. By hitting `/api` on a deployed link, the API is explained there.

Both work together in delivering code and understanding to students!
